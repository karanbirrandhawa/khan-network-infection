# Khan Academy Infection

Created for Khan Academy project interview. Showcases a user network graph with two types of relations "coached" and "coached by". Simulated infection within network: as one user is updated to a certain version all of its relations must be updated as well. This continues until whole graph is updated/infected.

## Running project

Ensure that Java is installed. Then simply go into project and run the following commands:

	javac Tester.java
	java Tester

And you should be able to see the test cases in action.

## Future Work

Given more time I would have liked to implement a visualization for my infection algorithm to showcase it in action. I would also like to take the time to properly document/comment my classes and methods.
